Welcome to Adventures Beyond Wonderland!

00:07.250 --> 00:09.100 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:85%
To join in on the adventure

00:09.300 --> 00:13.900 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:85%
simply place a bet on one or more of the seven options.

00:14.300 --> 00:16.900 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:85%
If the result is 2 or 5 Wonderspins

00:17.100 --> 00:21.800 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:85%
the White Rabbit will take you to an adventure beyond Wonderland.

00:23.100 --> 00:24.900 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:85%
Each Wonderspin can enhance your bet

00:25.000 --> 00:27.500 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:85%
by landing on one of the beloved characters.

00:28.500 --> 00:31.500 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:85%
Each character starts with a different Multiplier.

00:32.800 --> 00:36.200 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:85%
There are three enchanting stages to a Wonderspin:

00:36.300 --> 00:39.500 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:85%
First, the inner clock chooses either a Multiplier

00:39.700 --> 00:41.500 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:85%
or an additional Wonderspin.

00:42.400 --> 00:44.600 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:85%
Then, if a Multiplier is chosen

00:44.700 --> 00:46.700 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:85%
the rabbit will randomly pick a character

00:47.100 --> 00:50.000 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:85%
and add that Multiplier to the current one.

00:53.100 --> 00:57.000 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:85%
And finally, the wheel will spin to reveal the results!

00:58.100 --> 01:03.200 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:85%
The results of all Wonderspins add up to give your final Multiplier.

01:03.900 --> 01:07.200 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:85%
What's more – a winning bet on the Magic Dice

01:07.300 --> 01:09.900 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:85%
takes you to the interactive dice game.

01:10.700 --> 01:11.800 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:85%
Choose your path –

01:12.200 --> 01:13.900 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:85%
follow the red or the white dice:

01:14.300 --> 01:16.300 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:85%
pick your lucky dice and enjoy the game!

01:16.800 --> 01:18.300 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:85%
Based on the result of the dice,

01:18.500 --> 01:20.800 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:85%
you can either win a Multiplier and finish the game,

01:21.200 --> 01:25.500 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:85%
or progress further to potentially claim a bigger reward.

01:25.800 --> 01:30.300 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:85%
If you're extra lucky, you might even multiply all your possible wins!

01:30.800 --> 01:34.600 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:85%
If the wheel lands on the mystery segment you have options:

01:35.500 --> 01:41.900 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:85%
You can get a free spin with multiplied bets.

01:42.500 --> 01:44.800 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:85%
Or, you can choose one of the card soldiers

01:45.000 --> 01:48.100 line:12 position:50% align:middle size:85%
that will march in to get a fixed prize.
